# Run the executable
Download VR Virtual Workspace.exe from repository and run using unity (Oculus compatible only).

# Purpose/Implementation
Simulate the art of water-bending through the use of cohesive water particles -- Gives the use full control over the viscosity and the direction of the water flow by trigger sensitivity, and also allows for one-handed or two-handed water control.

Used the unity engine and the Cculus VR integration. Created terrain using simple texture packs and water through use of particles with predetermined behavioral relationships with each other.
